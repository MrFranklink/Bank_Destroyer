## ? **Your Implementation Status:**

### **1. Minimum Loan Amount** ? **MATCHES**
```csharp
// Line 38
() => loanAmount < 10000 ? Error("Minimum loan amount is Rs. 10,000") : null,
```
**Status:** ? **Correct!** Enforces Rs. 10,000 minimum

---

### **2. Interest Rates** ? **MATCHES**
```csharp
// Lines 107-123
private decimal CalculateLoanInterestRate(decimal loanAmount, bool isSeniorCitizen)
{
    if (isSeniorCitizen)
    {
        return 9.5m;  // Fixed rate for senior citizens
    }

    if (loanAmount <= 500000)
    {
        return 10.0m;  // 10% for up to 5 lakhs
    }
    else if (loanAmount <= 1000000)
    {
        return 9.5m;   // 9.5% for 5 lakhs to 10 lakhs
    }
    else
    {
        return 9.0m;   // 9% for above 10 lakhs
    }
}
```

**Comparison:**

| Loan Amount | Required Rate | Your Rate | Status |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Up to 5L | 10% | 10% | ? Match |
| 5L to 10L | 9.5% | 9.5% | ? Match |
| Above 10L | 9% | 9% | ? Match |
| Senior Citizen | 9.5% | 9.5% | ? Match |

**Status:** ? **Perfect Match!**

### **3. EMI Validation** ? **MATCHES**
```csharp
// Lines 66-74
// Calculate EMI using formula: EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1]
decimal monthlyInterestRate = (interestRate / 100) / 12;
double powerTerm = Math.Pow((double)(1 + monthlyInterestRate), tenureMonths);
decimal emi = loanAmount * monthlyInterestRate * (decimal)powerTerm / ((decimal)powerTerm - 1);

// Validate EMI is not more than 60% of monthly salary
decimal maxAllowedEMI = monthlySalary * 0.60m;
if (emi > maxAllowedEMI)
{
    return Error($"EMI amount (Rs. {emi:N2}) exceeds 60% of monthly salary (Rs. {maxAllowedEMI:N2})...");
}
```

**Formula Used:** ? **Correct!**
```
EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1]

Where:
P = Loan Amount (Principal)
R = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)
N = Tenure in Months
```

**Validation:** ? **Correct!**
- Monthly salary is input parameter ?
- EMI cannot exceed 60% of salary ?
- Clear error message ?

**Status:** ? **Perfect Implementation!**

### **4. Senior Citizen Rules** ? **MATCHES**
```csharp
// Lines 52-60
bool isSeniorCitizen = customer.DOB.HasValue && IdGenerator.IsSeniorCitizen(customer.DOB.Value);

// Apply senior citizen rules
if (isSeniorCitizen)
{
    if (loanAmount > 100000)
    {
        return Error("Senior citizens cannot be sanctioned a loan greater than Rs. 1 lakh (Rs. 100,000)");
    }
}
```

**Requirements:**

// Lines 88-96
return Success(
    $"Loan Account opened successfully! Account ID: {lnAccountId}, 
     Loan Amount: Rs. {loanAmount:N2}, 
     Interest Rate: {interestRate}%{seniorCitizenNote}, 
     Tenure: {tenureMonths} months, 
     EMI: Rs. {emi:N2}",
    lnAccountId,
    loanAmount,
    null,

## ?? **EMI Calculation Examples:**

### **Example 1: Normal Customer**
```
Loan Amount: Rs. 3,00,000
Interest Rate: 10% (?5L)
Tenure: 24 months
Monthly Salary: Rs. 50,000

Calculation:
Monthly Interest = 10/12/100 = 0.008333
EMI = [300000 × 0.008333 × (1.008333)^24] / [(1.008333)^24 - 1]
EMI = Rs. 13,860.35

Validation:
Max EMI = 50,000 × 60% = Rs. 30,000
Rs. 13,860.35 < Rs. 30,000 ? Approved!
```

### **Example 2: Senior Citizen**
```
Loan Amount: Rs. 80,000
Interest Rate: 9.5% (Senior Citizen)
Tenure: 12 months
Monthly Salary: Rs. 30,000

Calculation:
Monthly Interest = 9.5/12/100 = 0.007917
EMI = [80000 × 0.007917 × (1.007917)^12] / [(1.007917)^12 - 1]
EMI = Rs. 6,952.74

Validation:
1. Amount ? Rs. 1,00,000 ?
2. Max EMI = 30,000 × 60% = Rs. 18,000
3. Rs. 6,952.74 < Rs. 18,000 ? Approved!
```

### **Example 3: High Loan Amount**
```
Loan Amount: Rs. 15,00,000
Interest Rate: 9% (>10L)
Tenure: 60 months
Monthly Salary: Rs. 1,00,000

Calculation:
Monthly Interest = 9/12/100 = 0.0075
EMI = [1500000 × 0.0075 × (1.0075)^60] / [(1.0075)^60 - 1]
EMI = Rs. 31,136.79

Validation:
Max EMI = 1,00,000 × 60% = Rs. 60,000
Rs. 31,136.79 < Rs. 60,000 ? Approved!
```

### **Example 4: EMI Too High (Rejected)**
```
Loan Amount: Rs. 10,00,000
Interest Rate: 9% (>10L)
Tenure: 12 months
Monthly Salary: Rs. 50,000

Calculation:
EMI = Rs. 87,262.84

Validation:
Max EMI = 50,000 × 60% = Rs. 30,000
Rs. 87,262.84 > Rs. 30,000 ? REJECTED!

Error: "EMI amount (Rs. 87,262.84) exceeds 60% of 
        monthly salary (Rs. 30,000.00)"
```
