# Employee Dashboard Implementation - Complete Guide

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete **Employee Dashboard** with department-based permissions for the ASP.NET MVC Banking Application (.NET Framework 4.8). The dashboard dynamically shows different features based on the employee's department (DEPT01 or DEPT02).

---

## Implementation Summary

### 1. **Files Modified**

#### A. `Bank_App/Controllers/DashboardController.cs`
**Changes Made:**
- Updated `Index()` action to load employee-specific data (customers, accounts, department info)
- Modified all action methods to support department-based authorization:
  - `RegisterCustomer()` - Now allows both MANAGER and EMPLOYEE (DEPT01/DEPT02)
  - `OpenSavingsAccount()` - Allows MANAGER and DEPT01 employees
  - `OpenFixedDepositAccount()` - Allows MANAGER and DEPT01 employees
  - `OpenLoanAccount()` - Allows MANAGER and DEPT02 employees
  - `Deposit()` - Allows MANAGER and DEPT01 employees
  - `Withdraw()` - Only MANAGER (no change)
  - `CloseAccount()` - Department-specific logic (DEPT01: Savings/FD, DEPT02: Loans)

**Authorization Logic Example:**
```csharp
string role = Session["Role"]?.ToString().ToUpper();
string deptId = Session["DeptId"]?.ToString();

// Check if user is manager or employee from DEPT01
if (role != "MANAGER" && !(role == "EMPLOYEE" && deptId == "DEPT01"))
{
    TempData["ErrorMessage"] = "Access denied. Only managers or Deposit Management (DEPT01) employees can open savings accounts.";
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
```

#### B. `Bank_App/Views/Dashboard/EmployeeDashboard.cshtml`
**Complete Redesign:**
- Modern Bootstrap 5 UI with gradient backgrounds
- Department-specific color schemes:
  - **DEPT01 (Deposit Management)**: Blue gradient (`#667eea` to `#00c9ff`)
  - **DEPT02 (Loan Management)**: Pink/Red gradient (`#f857a6` to `#ff5858`)
- Dynamic tab visibility based on department
- Statistics card showing total customers
- Animations and hover effects

#### C. `BankApp.Services/EmployeeService.cs`
**Added Method:**
```csharp
public EmployeeDTO GetEmployeeById(string empId)
{
    var employee = _employeeRepo.GetEmployeeById(empId);
    if (employee == null)
        return null;

    return new EmployeeDTO
    {
        Empid = employee.Empid,
        EmployeeName = employee.EmployeeName,
        DeptId = employee.DeptId,
        Pan = employee.Pan
    };
}
```

#### D. `Bank_App/Controllers/AuthController.cs`
**Updated Login Method:**
```csharp
// Store Department ID for employees
if (result.Role.ToUpper() == "EMPLOYEE")
{
    var employee = _employeeService.GetEmployeeById(result.ReferenceID);
    Session["DeptId"] = employee?.DeptId ?? "UNKNOWN";
}
```
- Now uses `EmployeeService` instead of directly accessing DB
- Maintains proper architecture: Bank_App ? BankApp.Services ? DB

```

### Department ID Storage Flow:
```
Login ? AuthService.ValidateLogin()

      ? Dashboard loads with department-specific features
```

## 8. **Code Architecture**

### Three-Layer Architecture:
```
???????????????????????????????????????????
?         Bank_App (MVC Layer)            ?
?  - Controllers (DashboardController)    ?
?  - Views (EmployeeDashboard.cshtml)    ?
???????????????????????????????????????????
                  ? References
                  ?
???????????????????????????????????????????
?      BankApp.Services (Service Layer)   ?
?  - EmployeeService                      ?
?  - CustomerService                      ?
?  - AccountManagementService             ?
???????????????????????????????????????????
                  ? References
                  ?
???????????????????????????????????????????
?         DB (Data Layer)                 ?
?  - EmployeeRepository                   ?
?  - CustomerRepository                   ?
?  - AccountRepository                    ?
???????????????????????????????????????????
```

**Key Principle:**
- ? Bank_App ONLY references BankApp.Services
- ? BankApp.Services references DB
- ? Bank_App NEVER directly references DB

## 12. **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: Department not showing correctly

### Issue: Access denied on allowed action
**Solution:** Verify role and department in session variables:
```javascript
console.log(Session["Role"]);
console.log(Session["DeptId"]);
```

### Issue: Tabs not appearing
**Solution:** Ensure `ViewBag.DeptId` is passed from controller to view

### Issue: Build errors
**Solution:** Verify project references:
- Bank_App ? BankApp.Services
- BankApp.Services ? DB
- Remove any direct DB references from Bank_App
